## Review

This was a very enjoyable course - the combination of Coursera autograding (if you're willing to shell out for it) plus the lectures and projcts were very well thought out. 

Week 5 turned out to be unexpectedly hard - your hand was held for weeks 1-4 and then you're just dumped into making a CPU via a diagram. Here it is extremely useful to have the book to flip back and forth through the chapters as the CPU spec does require you to re-review chapter 3 repeatedly (esp. with regard to the C instruction bits). This was quite possibly the hardest part for this course - the assembler afterward was mostly very straightforward.
